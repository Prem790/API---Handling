Introduction 
Welcome to the "Handle APIs Like a Pro in React.js" project! This project aims to demonstrate how to efficiently manage API calls, handle loading and error states, and address race conditions in a React.js application. By leveraging Axios for HTTP requests and creating custom React Query hooks, we can achieve a robust and user-friendly application.

This README will guide you through the backend and frontend implementation, providing detailed explanations to ensure you understand the underlying concepts and can replicate them in your projects.

Backend
Overview
The backend is built using Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. The server provides an API endpoint to fetch a list of products, simulating a typical e-commerce backend service. Additionally, it supports searching products by name using query parameters.

Detailed Explanation
Express Server Setup:
The backend starts with setting up an Express server. Express is imported, and an instance of the app is created. The server listens on port 3000 or a port specified in the environment variables. This setup allows the server to handle incoming HTTP requests and respond accordingly.

API Endpoint:
The main API endpoint is /api/products. When a GET request is made to this endpoint, the server responds with a list of products. Each product has an id, name, price, and image URL.

Search Functionality:
The server supports searching products by name. If a search query parameter is included in the request (e.g., /api/products?search=wooden), the server filters the products based on the search term. This is achieved using the JavaScript filter method on the array of products, checking if the product name includes the search term.

Simulated Delay:
To simulate a real-world scenario where network latency might cause a delay in responses, a 3-second delay is added before the server sends back the product data. This helps in demonstrating how the frontend handles loading states.

Frontend
Overview
The frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The main component, App.jsx, demonstrates how to handle API calls using Axios, manage loading and error states, and handle race conditions with the AbortController.

Detailed Explanation
State Management:
The frontend uses React's useState hook to manage four states:

products: An array that stores the list of products fetched from the API.
error: A boolean that indicates if there was an error fetching the data.
loading: A boolean that indicates if the data is currently being fetched.
search: A string that stores the search query input by the user.
useEffect Hook:
The useEffect hook is used to make API calls whenever the search state changes. It handles the side effect of fetching data from the backend. Within useEffect, an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is used to handle asynchronous operations.

AbortController:
An AbortController is used to handle race conditions. When a new search query is entered, the previous API request is aborted if it has not yet completed. This prevents multiple ongoing requests from causing race conditions and ensures only the latest search query's result is used.

API Call with Axios:
Axios is used to make the HTTP GET request to the backend API. The signal property from the AbortController is passed to Axios to enable request cancellation. If the request is successful, the product data is stored in the products state. If an error occurs, the error state is set to true.

Conditional Rendering:
The component conditionally renders different UI elements based on the state:

If loading is true, a loading message is displayed.
If error is true, an error message is displayed.
The number of products fetched is displayed when the data is successfully loaded.
Custom React Query Hook
The project also hints at a potential custom React Query hook that can be created for more reusable code. This custom hook would encapsulate the logic for data fetching, including state management for loading and errors, and could be used across different components.
